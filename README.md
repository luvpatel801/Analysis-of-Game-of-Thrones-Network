# Analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones-Network

The American fantasy drama Television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss - Game of Thrones is a modification of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin’s extensive series of fantasy novels. The series registers the vicious dynastic struggles among the kingdom’s high-born families for the Iron Throne, while other families fight for liberty from it. With so many characters to keep track of in this sprawling chronicle, it can be more than a challenge to completely understand the dynamics between them and interweaving plotlines. 

The aim of this term project is to identify different characteristics of a small subgraph of this underlying complex network and to make sense of the complicated character relationships and their significance on the future plot by analyzing the network step by step using the techniques learnt in class.
